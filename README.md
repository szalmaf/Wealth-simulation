# Wealth-simulation

This [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/szalmaf/Wealth-simulation/blob/master/Bernoulli_wealth_simulation.ipynb) is a replication of the results of Ole Peters' TEDx talk, ["Time and Chance"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGqOH3sYmQA), revealing how a simple non-ergodic system behaves when described in the following two ways:
* when taking an ensemble average or 
* run for a long time (without averaging). 

Paradoxially, the ensemble average shows increasing wealth, while the long time simulation shows decreasing wealth.
